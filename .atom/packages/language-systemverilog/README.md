# [SystemVerilog language support in Atom](https://atom.io/packages/language-systemverilog)

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to SystemVerilog files in Atom.

This an update to [Razer6's language-verilog](https://atom.io/packages/language-verilog), originally done in order to have Atom make the distinction between Verilog and SystemVerilog (thereby avoiding linter complaints about non-Verilog code and adding some bits to the [script](https://atom.io/packages/script) package that'll allow me to run Verilog and SV files differently).

It's been updated according to [jfrogget's clone](https://github.com/jfrogget/language-verilog) and the [other outstanding pull requests](https://github.com/Razer6/language-verilog/pulls).

If you'd like to take this over, you're very welcome to.
